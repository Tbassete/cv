        <h2>graduation</h2>
        
        <div><p>I am currently focused on honing my skills in Software Engineering at <a href="https://www.unicesumar.edu.br/">Unicesumar</a>, with an expected completion in 2025. Throughout my academic journey, I have dedicated myself to learning and applying practices in all stages of software development, providing a comprehensive understanding of the development life cycle.</p></div>
        
        <div><p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I have sought to enhance my practical skills through specific courses. I completed the HTML and CSS course offered by the renowned instructor <a href="https://www.cursoemvideo.com/sobre/">Gustavo Guanabara</a> at <a href="https://www.cursoemvideo.com/">Curso em Vídeo</a>, establishing a solid foundation for web interface development. Similarly, I deepened my knowledge of JavaScript through the Curso em Vídeo.</p></div>

        <div><p>Furthermore, I pursued expertise in modern technologies such as Node.js through online courses available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLqq6FemMNQ&list=PLJ_KhUnlXUPtbtLwaxxUxHqvcNQndmI4B">YouTube</a>. This hands-on approach allowed me to explore the intricacies of server-side development in a more dynamic manner.</p></div>
        <div><p>Additionally, to expand my knowledge of front-end frameworks, I engaged in courses on the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> platform, where I acquired skills in React, Angular, and Vue.js. This array of technologies has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of contemporary tools used in web development.</p></div>
        <div><p>I am eager to continue learning and applying these skills to develop innovative and effective solutions throughout my professional journey.</p></div>
